### Network Forensics
This field contains an extensive collection of topics related to network communication. For instance, identifying various types of DDoS attacks from capture files requires extracting attack statistics, a list of attacking bots, determining the type of attack (TCP SYN flood, UDP/ICMP flood, HTTP GET/POST flood, HTTP flood with browser emulation, etc.). 
The research topics include the usage of machine learning and other methods for automatic analysis of data, content identification and extraction, communication capturing and evidence extraction, etc.
