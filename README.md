# Cyber-Security-and-Forensics
The course introduces the basics of filesystems, operating systems, and usage in the area of digital forensics. We will learn essential cybersecurity principles and incident response techniques. Moreover, we will try out various attacks, their detection, and how to create countermeasures.
<br>

## Key Outcomes
- Understanding fundamental concepts of cybersecurity and digital investigation
- Learning how to acquire a forensic image and examine filesystems, OS, and data
- Gaining skills for incident responses and forensics with real-world cybersecurity case studies
- Learning the essentials of cryptography, password protection, and cracking
- Getting hands-on experience to develop skills via open-source security tools
- Try out real cyber attacks in a lab environment and learn how to protect your system against such attacks

## Team Project
### Network Forensics
This field contains an extensive collection of topics related to network communication. For instance, identifying various types of DDoS attacks from capture files requires extracting attack statistics, a list of attacking bots, determining the type of attack (TCP SYN flood, UDP/ICMP flood, HTTP GET/POST flood, HTTP flood with browser emulation, etc.). 
The research topics include the usage of machine learning and other methods for automatic analysis of data, content identification and extraction, communication capturing and evidence extraction, etc.
